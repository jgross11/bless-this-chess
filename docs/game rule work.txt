game rule category
feature, constraint, win condition, draw condition, stalemate condition

note: game rules can have their own sub rules
note: distinction between game rule template and instance of game rule
i.e. template: additional move for piece, instance: pawns move sideways (torpedo)

proposed game rule structure:
category: category of the rule
template: generic rule purpose (function?)
subrules: rules that influence this rule's functionality
parameters: information that creates concrete game rule instance from template, based on game information
